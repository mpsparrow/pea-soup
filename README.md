Pea Soup is a Discord bot which servers as a connection between Blackwake servers and Discord over FTP.

## This code is very much not complete
Due to the state of Blackwake and me no longer running a Blackwake server, I never ended up finishing this bot. If this gains some interest or Blackwake pops off again then I may finish it up.

### Things To Do
If I ever finish this:
- Connect to my Blackwake leaderboard script so the bot can display the leaderboard.
- Setup mySQL connection to store server connection information and other info.
- System to keep servers managed separately so bot can run on multiple different Discord servers independantly and also manage multiple different Blackwake servers on one Discord server.
- Web portal to manage things in a more secure way?
- Figure out a way over FTP or alternative server scripts to be able to read live logs. This would allow much more information to be stored and seen through Discord; such as live ship information, vote kicks, mod kicks, mutinies, etc.
